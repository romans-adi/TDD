<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# <a name="about-project"> TDD Project </a>

The project involves creating a Ruby class called Solver with three methods: factorial, reverse, and fizzbuzz. The factorial method calculates the factorial of a given positive integer, the reverse method reverses a given string, and the fizzbuzz method returns specific strings based on certain conditions for a given integer.

<!-- Features -->

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- [x] Test-Driven Development (TDD): The project follows the TDD approach, where tests are written before implementing the methods. This ensures that each method is thoroughly tested and functions correctly before moving on to the next step.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```ruby -v```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

> cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

> git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/TDD.git

Using HTTPS:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/TDD.git

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/TDD.git enumerable

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the Enumerable repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies (in this case, we assume there are no external dependencies, so this step may not be needed):
```bundle install```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the TDD files.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```ruby main.rb```

3. The decoded message will be displayed as the output.

4. If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.

### Tests <a name="tests"></a>

To run the tests for the Solver class, ensure you are in the directory containing the test files.

1. Install RSpec:

Once you have Ruby installed, you can use RubyGems (Ruby's package manager) to install RSpec. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```gem install rspec```

2. Run the tests for the factorial method using the following command:

```rspec factorial_spec.rb```

3. Run the tests for the reverse method using the following command:

```rspec reverse.rb```

4. 3. Run the tests for the reverse method using the following command:

```rspec fizzbuzz.rb```

5. All tests should pass without any errors or failures, ensuring that the Solver class and its methods are functioning correctly.

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] Power Calculation: Add a method to calculate the power of a number. For example, given inputs base and exponent, the method should return base^exponent.
- [ ] Fibonacci Series: Implement a method to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
